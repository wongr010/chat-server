How our invite works: If a user wants to invite someone to his/her conference then he/she sends him/her a INVITE request ("/invite confID username" format) , which is sent to our server and redirected to the appropriate user. The user gets the message and is asked if he/she wants to join. If he/she approves, the server sends him a JOIN ACK. If the user dissaproves, the server sends the inviter user a INVITE_NAK message.
